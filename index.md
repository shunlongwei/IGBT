## What is IGBT Module

What is an IGBT power module?
An [IGBT](https://www.slw-ele.com/) is a is power semiconductor die and is the short form of insulated-gate bipolar transistor.

An IGBT power module is the assembly and physical packaging of several IGBT power semiconductor dies in one package. The dies are normally connected in a selected electrical configuration such as half-bridge, 3-level, dual, chopper, booster, etc.

An IGBT power module functions as a switch and can be used to switch electrical power on and off extremely fast and with high energy efficiency.

The IGBT [power module](https://www.shunlongwei.com) is becoming the preferred device for high power applications due to its ability to enhance switching, temperature, weight and cost performance.
